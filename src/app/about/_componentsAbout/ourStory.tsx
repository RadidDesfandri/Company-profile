                        <p className='text-gray-200 text-sm pb-5 '>In 2004, fellow MIT graduate students Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah noticed a major shift in the way people shop and purchase products. Buyers didnâ€™t want to be interrupted by ads, they wanted helpful information. In 2006, they founded Alpha to help companies use that shift to grow better with inbound marketing.</p>
                        <p className='text-gray-200 text-sm'>Along the way, Alpha expanded beyond marketing into a crafted, not cobbled suite of products that create the frictionless customer experience that buyers expect today. Expertly led by CEO Yamini Rangan, Alpha uses its customer platform built on an AI-powered Smart CRM to help millions of scaling organizations grow better.</p>
